## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the C programs, use the following commands in the terminal:

(in MacOS)
```bash
gcc -o output_file_name source_file.c
```
```bash
./output_file_name 
```
(in Windows)
```bash
gcc -o output_file_name.exe source_file.c
```
```bash
output_file_name.exe
```
